# Geodjangoapp

Simple Geodjangoapp with Kenya Data overlaid

Implimenting the Django framework with python to get to map some Kenya data including Kenya Counties, Kenya wetlands, Kenya towns, Kenya Highland roads and Kenya Forest Ranges. A toggle option utilising folium to be able to uncheck the layers. This can be a foundation to other Geospatial Applications implimenting the django framework.
